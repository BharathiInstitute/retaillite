  Tulasi Shop Lite - Installation Guide
========================================

STEP 1: Run TulasiStores_Setup.exe

   Most computers will install without any issues.
   Just double-click and follow the steps.


IF WINDOWS SHOWS A WARNING:
----------------------------

A) "Windows protected your PC" (Blue SmartScreen popup)
   → Click "More info"
   → Click "Run anyway"
   This is normal for new software. It is safe.

B) "Smart App Control blocked a file" (No "Run anyway" button)
   → You need to turn off Smart App Control (one time only):

   1. Open Settings (Win + I)
   2. Go to: Privacy & Security → Windows Security
   3. Click "App & Browser Control"
   4. Click "Smart App Control settings"
   5. Select "Off"
   6. Now run TulasiStores_Setup.exe again

   Note: This is a one-time change. You won't see
   this problem again for any future updates.
